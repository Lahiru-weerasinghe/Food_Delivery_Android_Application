'FoodSetGo' Restaurant in Colombo sells a wide variety of foods. People are increasingly choosing to eat at this restaurant because of the cheaper prices and delicious food. Meanwhile, as the number of customers grows, a new issue arises. Because the restaurant's space is limited, it can only seat a certain number of customers at a given moment, therefore the whole customer resource is not available. The solution to resolve this issue is to use a mobile food ordering application. Customers who use this application do not need to go to the restaurant on their own; instead, they can order dishes from their Android mobile phones from anywhere.  The Background Management platform in this application was designed for the administrator. Food dishes, dish orders, payments, and feedback will be managed by the Administrator.
